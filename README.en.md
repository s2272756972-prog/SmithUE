A high-performance Unreal Engine editor plugin that exposes the editor's full capabilities through a command protocol, turning repetitive manual operations into scriptable, AI-driven workflows.

> `UE5.5` compatibility branch: adapted from SmithUE v1.15.0 and verified with Unreal Engine 5.5 BuildPlugin.

---

## For AI Agents

### Quick Deployment (Windows)
```bash
# Verify editor is running and SmithUE plugin is enabled
npx smithue-cli status
npx smithue-cli exec ping '{}'
npx smithue-cli list
```

### Troubleshooting Tree
1. Editor not running → Start Unreal Engine Editor and wait for full load
2. Multiple instances → Use `npx smithue-cli status --pid <pid>` to specify instance
3. Stale portfiles → Run `npx smithue-cli prune` to clean up

## Quick Start

1. Clone into `{YourProject}/Plugins/` on branch `UE5.5`:
   ```bash
   cd {YourProject}/Plugins
   git clone -b UE5.5 https://github.com/s2272756972-prog/SmithUE.git
   ```

2. Build your project with Unreal Engine 5.5.

3. Launch the editor. SmithUE automatically starts the HTTP server and assigns a dynamic port.

4. Verify the connection:
   ```bash
   npx smithue-cli status
   ```

### Self-check & one-click CLI install (recommended)

On startup the plugin detects your **Node / npm / smithue-cli** environment in the background (non-blocking; each probe is logged to `LogSmithUE`). Open **Editor → Project Settings → Plugins → SmithUE → "Status & Updates"** to:

- See Node / npm / smithue-cli versions and status;
- **Install / upgrade smithue-cli** with one click. The button adapts to state (Not installed → Install / Outdated → Upgrade / Ready → disabled confirmation). On a poor network it **auto-times-out after 120s and is cancellable**, with classified failure hints and a manual fallback;
- See plugin-update reminders with a link to GitHub Releases.

> Even without the CLI installed, **the plugin's HTTP tool capabilities are unaffected** — the CLI is just a convenience consumer client. This is especially friendly for restricted enterprise intranets and legacy machines.

**Note**: SmithUE now uses `smithue-cli` for interaction. See [s2272756972-prog/smithue-cli (UE5.1 / UE5.5 compatibility branch)](https://github.com/s2272756972-prog/smithue-cli/tree/ue5.1-ue5.5-compat).

## Connection Status Indicator

SmithUE displays a circular status indicator in the editor status bar showing real-time CLI connection state.

### Indicator Colors

| Color | State |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | Ready — HTTP server started and port assigned, reachable via CLI |
| 🔴 Gray | Not Ready — Server not started or initializing |

### Interactive Features

- **Tooltip Details**:
  - **SmithUE version** (read from `.uplugin`)
  - **Port** — Current dynamically assigned HTTP port
  - **PID** — Current editor process ID
  - **Status** — Ready state confirmation
- **One-Click Copy**: Click the indicator to copy the base `smithue-cli` command for the current instance.

## AI Texture Generation

The `generate_texture` command bridges the editor with modern generative AI. It automatically detects the target API format based on the provided endpoint URL, supporting DALL-E, Imagen, and OpenAI Chat-based generation.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
npx smithue-cli exec generate_texture '{"params":{"prompt":"seamless stylized stone floor, hand-painted style, 4K","endpoint":"https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations","api_key":"sk-...","model":"dall-e-3","save_path":"/Game/Textures","asset_name":"T_StoneFloor"}}'
```

## Changelog

> Full history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

### v1.15.0 (UE5.2, 2026-07-03)
- **AnimGraph editing tools**: added 8 tools for anim-node property edits, optional pin exposure, member-variable bindings, anim-node reads, and state-machine / state / transition authoring with state-machine read-back.
- **Cross-class Blueprint node fixes**: `bp_create_node` adds `owner_class` for cross-class VariableGet/Set; `target_class` accepts `/Game/...` Blueprint paths and resolves DynamicCast generated `_C` classes.
- **Asset deletion and port maintenance**: `delete_asset force=true` now truly force-deletes and nulls in-memory referencers; portfile prune now uses PID liveness.
- **Release tooling**: `regen-tools.mjs` supports a `SMITHUE_PORT` override for regenerating `TOOLS.md` from another host editor that shares the plugin.

### v1.12.0 (UE5.2, 2026-06-26)
- **Self-describing material tools**: `connect_material_pins` `dest_input_index` now documents `7=WorldPositionOffset` (was 0–6 only); `set_expression_property` lists node-type-specific valid keys and its error echoes the node's valid keys. PITFALLS #15.

### v1.11.0 (UE5.2, 2026-06-25)
- **Startup environment self-check**: detects Node / npm / smithue-cli in the background on editor launch, off the game thread, logging each probe to `LogSmithUE`.
- **"Status & Updates" settings panel**: view environment status, plugin-update reminder (GitHub Releases link), one-click install / upgrade of the CLI; the button adapts to state (Install / Upgrade / Ready / Cancel).
- **Bounded install**: CLI install uses a **120s hard timeout + cancel + npm fast-fail flags** so a bad network never freezes the UI; failures are classified (permission / network / timeout) with a manual fallback.

### v1.10.0
- **Fixed `level_new` crash**: map creation deferred to the next-frame safe point, avoiding world destruction inside the HTTP handler.
- **Added** `spawn_mesh_actor` (mesh + material) and `level_add_basic_env` (one-shot lights / sky / fog / floor).
- **New LiveCoding domain** (`livecoding_status` / `livecoding_compile`).
- Tool count reaches **221 / 24 domains**.

### v0.8.0, CLI Migration
- Removed TCP Server / ConnectionManager / SessionManager; HTTP changed to dynamic port + portfile discovery.
- `/ready` endpoint + 503 startup guard; StatusIndicator rewritten as a CLI-aware dot.
- New `smithue-cli` npm package replaces MCP.

> Earlier versions (v1.x blueprint depth, N-id sessions, metrics, compliance linter, etc.) are in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Roadmap

> **Positioning: different from other UE AI plugins.** Most UE AI plugins stop at the "let AI drive the editor" demo; SmithUE targets real enterprise pain points — **legacy-project collaboration** and **asset compliance standardization** — and lays infrastructure groundwork for **future transcoding / migration standardization**. It delivers not one-off automation scripts, but a **git-trackable, auditable, team-reusable "atomic tool layer + spec layer."**

### Phase 1 (shipped) — Atomic capability foundation
- 24 domains, 229 atomic HTTP tools across Blueprint / AnimGraph / Material / Niagara / Level / Asset / Analysis, etc.
- Spec-driven blueprint factory + compliance linter: specs live as git text in the host project; AI generates compliant blueprints in bulk and audits them in plain language.
- Plugin environment self-check & self-service deployment (startup Node/npm/CLI detection, one-click install/upgrade panel), lowering the barrier for legacy machines / projects / intranet environments.

### Phase 2 — Legacy-project collaboration & compliance standardization
- **Bulk scan & audit of legacy assets**: rule-based health checks on naming / folders / parent class / material slots / LOD / collision, producing trackable compliance reports.
- **Bulk standardization fixes**: regularize existing assets against team specs in one shot; diffs are reviewable and reversible.
- **Team spec collaboration**: spec files committed with the project; everyone shares one compliance baseline; run the linter in CI as a gate.

### Phase 3 — Transcoding / migration standardization groundwork
- **Migration rule engine**: capture "legacy form → standard form" conversions as declarative, reusable rule sets.
- **Cross-version / cross-format asset transcoding pipelines**: repeatable pipelines for engine upgrades, asset-format migration, and standardization refactors.
- **End-to-end audit**: every transcoding / standardization step is logged for enterprise compliance and traceability.

### Phase 4 — Collaboration at scale
- Multi-client concurrent collaboration mode.
- Batch / transactional execution (multiple commands per request, atomic rollback).
- Dashboards & reports: asset health, compliance coverage, migration progress.
- Python SDK / REST OpenAPI / WebSocket real-time event stream.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Concurrency**: Single-client connection only.
- **Input Focus**: `simulate_key` requires viewport focus.
- **Property Types**: Advanced types like `TMap` or delegates are not supported by `set_actor_property`. Nested struct properties require dedicated commands.
- **SceneTexture**: `SceneTextureId` is set via FProperty reflection to avoid link errors with unexported engine symbols.
- **OS**: Windows Win64 only.
- **CLI is an optional consumer**: `smithue-cli` is a convenience client; its install / upgrade depends on the network (with a built-in 120s timeout, cancel, and manual fallback). **The plugin itself works without it.**
- **Engine version**: mainline targets UE 5.2; other versions require adaptation.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions on adding new commands.

### AI-Assisted Development

AI coding assistants (OpenCode, Claude Code, Cline, etc.) should read these repo-root files:

- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — repo boundaries, build commands, test systems, pitfalls
- **[docs/spec/](docs/spec/)** — tool authoring conventions (TOOL_SPEC + NAMING + PITFALLS)

The runtime `smithue-control` skill (for operating the editor, not development) ships with [smithue-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smithue-cli) (`smithue-cli skill --install`).

---

## Historical: MCP Server Deprecated
The MCP Server was removed in v0.8.0 and replaced by `smithue-cli`. See [smithue-cli MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/123dx-svg/smithue-cli/blob/main/MIGRATION.md) for the migration guide.
